1. All session contents for RDS22 will be posted to <u>the current GitHub website</u>. We will not be sending out any emails. Please check this website at least a day before each meeting to ensure you are up to date. 

	- [**https://wyoibc.github.io/rds22**](https://wyoibc.github.io/rds22)
	- [Raw repository for the above website](https://github.com/wyoibc/rds22.git) (for forking etc.)


2. Get a free [GitHub account](https://github.com) and memorize your password. You will use it often. Once you
login to your account, navigate to [this
repository](https://github.com/wyoibc/rds22) and click on ``Watch`` button in
the top right corner. This will help you keep track of changes being made
upstream. I will update the repository periodically.


3. [Join our Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/rds2022/shared_invite/zt-1b4vauy9f-WXbrP06lhDHkvbpvNDYtvA) for discussion between meeting sessions. Here is where you can ask questions and talk to your instructors during the week. We will also post announcements here instead of sending out emails. 


4. Install Git, the version control system on your computer

	- Mac OSX has a git client built into it. So no installation is
	  necessary.
	
	- If you use a Windows computer, install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

5. Make sure your ``git`` installation works.

	- Mac OSX: Open Terminal.app, and type ``git --version``. This should
	  print git version to the screen. If you get an error message, copy and post it on the Slack channel.

	- Git for Windows: Right click on desktop and choose ``Git Bash``,
	  which should open up a terminal window. If you run into issues, make
sure you followed instructions on their website (see above).


6. Download and install latest versions of R and RStudio

	- R can be downloaded from [r-project.org](https://r-project.org)

	- RStudio can be obtained from [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)



7. [Install ``Pandoc``](https://pandoc.org/installing.html), a versatile document converter (think plain text to html or pdf).

8. Install a text editor. We recommend ``vim`` (also called ``vi``).

	- [Windows installer can be accessed here](https://vim.org/download.php)

	- Macintosh: Your system comes pre-built with ``vim``. However, go ahead and get [this GUI version](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) which will be useful. 


**Note**: This page maybe updated every week and new tools maybe added which you might need for the next meeting. Please strive to install them before you come for future meetings.
