LEARNING OBJECTIVES 

Readers of this book will be able to:

Approach a study of a group of organisms by developing meaningful questions
Identify the appropriate methods to answer these questions
Where methods do not yet exist, be able to work on potential new methods
Understand limtations of methods and how to evaluate these limits
Draw sensible biological conclusions

WHAT YOU WILL NEED

R

Many methods are now implemented in R (R Core Team 2021): the phylogenetics task view has a brief overview. You can also install the relevant packages that are on CRAN and R-Forge using the task view itself:

install.packages("ctv")
library(ctv)
install.views("Phylogenetics")
Note that this will not install packages that are on GitHub or authorsâ€™ individual websites. The devtools package can be useful for installing packages directly from GitHub.


Other
RevBayes, BEAST, RAxML, and much other key software implement important methods in phylogenetics but are not in R. Readers will need to install these and many more, but fortunately the authors of much of this software have excellent tutorials already.
